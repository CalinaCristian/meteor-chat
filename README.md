# meteor-chat
A chat that alllows global, private and group chat, with options to add friends, see who's online, etc. It was made to help me in learning Meteor when i first started so it isn't using the best practices.


Update:
Now it supports facebook login, and adds facebook friends automatically to friends list if they logged in at least once in this app. You can still remove them if you want.
